Hey. So I created a tests for the class I'll share you. Can you write documentation by the next criteria:
    Application description: 1 paragraph, 2-5 Sentences.
    Regex implementation description: 1 paragraph, 4-10 Sentences.
    Information on how to open and run the project tests locally.
Here is my class what is needed to be documented:
object RegexValidatorUtil {

    private val stringValidationRegex: (Int, String) -> Regex = { maxLength, specialChars ->
        Regex(
            "^(?=.{1,$maxLength}$)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*$specialChars)(?!.*\\s).*$"
        )
    }

    /**
     * Validates the input string based on the following criteria:
     * 1. Maximum string length.
     * 2. At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list.
     * 3. No whitespace characters.
     *
     * @param input The input string to validate.
     * @param maxLength The maximum allowed length for the input string.
     * @return `true` if the input string matches the criteria, otherwise `false`.
     */
    fun isValidString(input: String, maxLength: Int, specialChars: String = ""): Boolean {
        val pattern = stringValidationRegex(maxLength, specialChars)
        return pattern.matches(input)
    }

Application Description

The RegexValidatorUtil is a utility class designed to validate strings against specific criteria. It ensures that a string has a predefined maximum length, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and a special character. The class also checks that the string does not contain any whitespace characters.
Regex Implementation Description

The core of the RegexValidatorUtil class is a regular expression defined in the stringValidationRegex function. This regex dynamically adjusts based on the provided maximum string length and special characters. The regex ensures the string meets the following criteria:

    The string length should not exceed the defined maximum length.
    It should contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.
    It should have at least one of the provided special characters.
    The string should not have any whitespace characters.
    The isValidString method uses this regex to validate an input string and returns true if the string matches the criteria, otherwise false.

How to Open and Run the Project Tests Locally

(Note: The actual steps may vary depending on how you've structured your project. Here's a general guide.)

    Clone the Repository: If the utility class is hosted on a platform like GitHub, start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the command:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the Project Directory: Once cloned, navigate to the directory containing the project.

bash

    cd path/to/project_directory

    Open the Project in Your IDE: Open the project using your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.

    Locate the Tests: Navigate to the test directory or locate the test class associated with RegexValidatorUtil.

    Run the Tests: Most IDEs have a built-in functionality to run tests. You can typically right-click on the test file and select the 'Run' option. If your project uses a build tool like Gradle or Maven, you might also be able to run the tests from the command line using a command like ./gradlew test or mvn test.

    Review Results: After running the tests, the IDE or command line tool will display the test results. Review these to ensure that all tests pass and the utility class functions as expected.

Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed and properly configured to avoid any issues during testing.

ok, so now could you please generate this using echo command in terminal to save it into README.md file?

Of course! Here's how you'd use the echo command in the terminal to save the provided documentation into a README.md file:

bash

You can simply copy and paste the above commands into your terminal to generate the README.md file.

ok, do the same but for Android studio
ChatGPT

To generate the documentation in README.md for an Android Studio project, the process is similar, but I'll provide more specific instructions tailored for Android Studio users:

    Open your Android Studio project.

    In the Project pane, right-click on the root directory of your project.

    Navigate to New > File and create a new file named README.md.

    Double-click README.md to open it in the editor.

    Copy the documentation content you've been provided with.

    Paste the content directly into the README.md file in Android Studio.

    Save the file.

However, if you're still keen on using the terminal approach:

    Navigate to the root directory of your Android Studio project in the terminal. You can use the built-in terminal in Android Studio or your system's terminal.

    Run the previously provided echo commands. This will append the documentation content to the README.md file.

After following either of the methods, you will have the documentation saved in the README.md file in the root directory of your Android Studio project.

generate the documentation for the project for Android Studio IDE using echo to save it into README.md file
ChatGPT

Absolutely! If you'd like to use the terminal approach within Android Studio's terminal to generate the README.md file, follow these steps:

    Open your Android Studio project.

    At the bottom of the Android Studio window, you'll find the Terminal tab. Click on it to open the terminal.

    In the terminal, you'll be in the root directory of your project by default.

    Now, paste the following echo commands:

bash

echo "### Documentation" > README.md
echo "---" >> README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "#### Application Description" >> README.md
